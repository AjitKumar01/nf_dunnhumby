Stage 22 -- Build the dataset for a basket model with household state.

This replaces 02/03 rather than extending them.  Those scripts exist to serve the
paper's model, and every one of their major filters is there to protect an
assumption this model drops:

  paper's pipeline                        here
  --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------
  at most one item per category per trip  a basket is a multiset; buy several items,
  -> 132 of 307 categories dropped        and several units of each
  categories independent                  items interact through a shared embedding
  Sunday + Monday only (172 sessions)     all 711 days, because state needs time
  -> 560 items, 56 categories             -> ~5,500 items, ~750 sub-commodities
  price = the only time-varying input     price + household state per sub-commodity
  prices pooled to chain level            store-level price where observed
  no assortment                           per-store availability, so an item a store
                                          never carries is not scored as "rejected"

What it writes to basket_input/:

  baskets.parquet   one row per (basket, item) purchase: units, store, split label
  items.parquet     item_id <-> PRODUCT_ID and the held-out labels (sub-commodity,
                    brand, manufacturer, department) that the model never sees
  log_price*.npy    [J, D] log price by item and day, carried forward
  store_price.npz   store-level price deviations where observed, plus the
                    per-store availability mask
  state.npz         the structure that answers "how long since this household last
                    bought this sub-commodity, as of this day"
  meta.json         sizes, split boundaries, and the frequency cut

The state lookup deserves a note.  The obvious implementations are both wrong at
this scale: materialising (household x day x sub-commodity) is ~32 million rows, and
a per-sample Python lookup is ~35 million dict hits per epoch.  Instead the purchase
days are stored once as a globally sorted key array, key = group_id * 1024 + day,
where group_id indexes a (household, sub-commodity) pair.  A single vectorised
np.searchsorted then answers the question for a whole batch, and because the offset
is larger than any day the ordering never crosses a group boundary.

Splitting is by household x week, as the paper does, so a household contributes to
several splits and the model is never asked to predict a household it has not seen.
The last weeks are held out rather than a random slice: a model meant to answer
"what happens next" should be tested on what happened next.

    #                    Restricting these to training weeks does not remove a leak, it
    #                    DELETES THE EXPERIMENT: held-out prices then carry forward from

    # Two things the chain-level panel gets wrong.
    #
    # 1. Price.  15.8% of store-item-weeks sit more than a cent from the chain price
    #    (sd across stores $0.12), so pooling puts measurement error straight into the
    #    regressor that the elasticity is read off.  Store-level cells are sparse
    #    though -- only 2.3% of the item x store x week grid is ever observed -- so
    #    the deviation is stored sparsely and the model falls back to the chain price
    #    wherever a store-week was not observed.  That is honest about what is known
    #    rather than imputing a store price from nothing.
    #
    # 2. Assortment.  The median store carries 63% of the catalogue and the 10th
    #    percentile store carries 39%.  Scoring an item a store has never stocked as
    #    a *rejected* alternative is a specification error: it was not available to
    #    reject.  dunnhumby has no stock-out feed (the paper's data did), so
