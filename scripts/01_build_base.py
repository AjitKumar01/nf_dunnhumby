Stage 1 -- Build the cleaned transaction base and the price panel.

transaction_data carries no price column, only sales_value and three discount
columns, so every price here is a reconstruction.  See the block comment in main()
and 10_price_definition_audit.py for the evidence behind each one; briefly,
base_price is the regular posted shelf price, loyalty_price is what a card holder
faces, paid_price is what the shopper actually handed over, and unit_price is
whichever of the first two the model consumes (NF_PRICE_BASIS, default "loyalty").

Outputs (parquet, in ../data):
    tx.parquet          cleaned lines, with base / loyalty / paid prices
    trips.parquet       one row per (household, day) trip; spend and spend_paid

    # transaction_data has no price column, so every price here is a construction
    # and each one answers a different question.  The user guide (p.3) states that
    # sales_value is the money the retailer receives, "taking the coupon match and
    # loyalty card discount into account", and that it is explicitly *not* what the
    # customer paid: a manufacturer coupon is reimbursed to the retailer, so the
    # shopper handed over sales_value + coupon_disc.  All three discount columns are
    # stored as negative numbers, so subtracting one adds it back.
    #
    # The guide's two named formulas have their labels swapped relative to its own
    # worked examples; the examples are authoritative.  Line 2 (q=2, sales_value
    # $2.00, retail_disc -$1.34) is called out as a regular shelf price of $1.67 and
    # a with-card price of $1.00, and line 3 as an outlay of $2.34 on sales_value of
    # $2.89 with a -$0.55 coupon.  The three definitions below reproduce all of it.
    #
    #   base_price     regular posted shelf price, before any discount -- the cost
    #                  borne by the retailer.  Exactly uniform across shoppers within
    #                  a product x store x week (99.1% of cells with >=2 buyers), so
    #                  this, not loyalty_price, is *the* posted price.
    #   loyalty_price  what a card holder faces at the shelf: base net of the loyalty
    #                  promotion, but before that shopper's own coupons.  Uniform in
    #                  only 92.9% of the same cells -- retail_disc carries a
    #                  household-idiosyncratic component (4.4% of cells have mixed
    #                  discount status among shoppers of the same item, store, week).

    #                  construction, and <= 0 on 21% of coupon lines, so it is a
